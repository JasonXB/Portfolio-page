            My interest in coding started back in 2016 while completing
            my degree in Mechanical Engineering. Back then we used Python and
            C++ to program remote-controlled and autonomous robotic vehicles. This led me
            down the design rabbit hole.

            Over the years I learned how to create my own physical products, so
            naturally the next step was to go digital! After a year of
            self-teaching, building personal projects, and losing my mind fixing
            really obscure bugs, I'm finally ready to make the leap and go pro. Wish me luck! ðŸ˜„
